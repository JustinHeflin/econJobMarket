This will involve multidisciplinary work with the energy economics and behavioural economics teams within the ESRI as well as partners from engineering, economics and mathematics from different national and international research institutions (e.g., University College Cork, University College Dublin, Trinity College Dublin, Queens University Belfast, North Carolina State University, Florida State University) and a number of industry collaborators. In particular, the successful candidate will be expected to work on an international, collaborative research project including partners from Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and the US. Driven by the requirement to improve environmental sustainability while maintaining security of energy supply and economic competitiveness, this project will explore ways to reduce the carbon footprint of the overall energy system. More specifically, the project aims at identifying optimal levels of decentralisation and electrification to achieve an affordable and efficient decarbonisation of the energy system while considering telecommunications and socio-economics as key enablers. Decentralisation is the movement from a power system where large power plants and centralised control lead the power grid to a system where control and generation of energy is provided by a near infinite number of small units. Electrification is the movement from fossil fuel based technologies such as conventional home heating systems and automobiles to electric based systems such as electric heat pumps and electric vehicles. Role DescriptionIn this context, the main responsibility of the successful candidate will be to identify research requirements and drive leading edge research in the field of energy technology adoption and use. For instance, research activities may include, but are not limited to, understanding the determinants of adoption and use of electrification technologies such as electric heat pumps or electric vehicles. Research activities are likely to include the design, implementation and evaluation of field experiments. Expected research findings and outputs will be published in leading international peer-reviewed energy economic conferences and journals.Skills, Qualifications and ExperienceCandidates must have, or be close to completing, a PhD in Economics or a related discipline with a substantial behavioural component and a strong interest in consumer behaviour and decision-making. Moreover, advanced statistics or econometric skills and research experience in the design of field experiments are expected. Desirable characteristics are:â¢	research experience in energy markets and tariffsâ¢	research experience in household choices affecting efficiency of energy use In addition, candidates will have excellent communication, computer and writing skills and will have demonstrated the ability to work within a highly motivated team and on their own initiative with proven ability to deliver high quality outputs to tight deadlines.How to applyTo apply, please click on the link below. The closing date for applications is 5pm Wed 30th November 2016. All applications will be acknowledged. Late or incomplete applications will not be processed.  The appointment will be for a three-year, fixed-term contract and salary will be in the range â¬38,554 - â¬42,838, commensurate with experience. The successful candidate will be based in our offices in Dublin 2. The appointee will also hold an adjunct position at Trinity College Dublin.The ESRI is an equal opportunities employer and is committed to accommodating the needs of people with disabilities to enable them to participate in the selection process.
